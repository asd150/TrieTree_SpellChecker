Trie is an efficient informtion retrievl data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optmal limit (key length). If we store keys in binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proortional to M * log N, where M is maximum string length and N is nuber of keys in tree. Using Trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. However the penalty is on Trie storage requiremets.
